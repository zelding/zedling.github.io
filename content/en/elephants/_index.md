questions:
    - q: Whats up with the domain? Are you zeDLing or zeLDing ?
      a: Frankly, I misspelled my nickname when I've created my account on Github. It is supposed to be ZeDlinG - one of my old nicknames :)
    - q: Why is there no contact information?
      a: I don't want some Ai to scrape my stuff, that's also the reason why the site is not indexed. I only would like to show this to a narrow selection of people. If you can read this, you should already know how to contact me. If you forgot (somehow), you should be able to find them through the linked social accounts in the footer.
    - q: Then why did you bother with "this and that"? - Those are SEO things.
      a: I still want to have a decent site. It is somewhat interesting too.
    - q: Why is English the default language?
      a: Why isn't everywhere? But seriously, this is IT. It should be in english only - yes, everything! Besides, english is the closest thing we have to global human language, I'm trying to help a bit ;) and if you are going to put me on refactoring some old bulgarian code, you better get me somebody who can translate it :P
    - q: These colors are bad for printing!
      a: Good. Don't waste paper on printing CVs. Can't you fetch a tablet or something? I've tried to make it somewhat bearable on mobiles too. It is better live anyways ;)

random:
    - s: I don't want to lead a team I don't know.
      e: The only reason I accepted a leading role, because I've worked with them with years. Although that is more that enough, some is required.  
    - s: I don't want to do an other presentation on technical debt.
      e: 
    - s: I can type `udpade` faster than `update`
