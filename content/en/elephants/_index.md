description: Elephants on the site
header_text: FAQ 
sitemap:
    changefreq: monthly
    priority: .4
questions:
    - q: Whats up with the domain? Are you zeDLing or zeLDing ?
      a: Frankly, I misspelled my nickname when I've created my account on Github. It is supposed to be ZeDlinG - gamer things :)
    - q: Why is there no contact information?
      a: I don't want some Ai to scrape my stuff, that's also the reason why the site is not indexed. I only would like to show this to a narrow selection of people. If you can read this, you should already know how to contact me. If you forgot (somehow), you should be able to find them through the linked social accounts in the footer.
    - q: Then why did you bother with "this and that"? - Those are SEO things.
      a: I still want to have a decent site and it's good to demonstrate my expectations.
    - q: Why is English the default language?
      a: Why isn't everywhere? But seriously, this is IT. IT should be in english only - yes, everything! Besides, english is the closest thing we have to global human language, I'm trying to help a bit ;)
    - q: These colors are bad for printing!
      a: Good. Don't waste paper on such nonsense as printing CVs. Ask for a tablet!
