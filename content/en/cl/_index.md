# Me { .pv1 .nny .tc .tl-l }

I&nbsp;am a PC guy first, programmer second. I like being organized and orderly, but I don't stress much on imperfections. I strive for quality and precision, but I acknowledge that is sometimes unnecessary. If you hire me, I'll stay, and do my best to become a pillar in your organization. This is what I've always done, frankly changing jobs is just a hassle for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just don't believe I won't ever leave. Luckily for you, I think the best system is the one that makes me replaceable too.

# You { .pv1 .tc .tl-l .bzz }

I&nbsp;am looking for a company where the attitude is considerate,
backgrounds are solid, execution is methodical, environmental&nbsp;effects and human&nbsp;rights are always considered.
